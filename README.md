# Alex Lane - SIP Engineer, Operations Tech and Dev-in-training

**Email: alexlane87@outlook.com**

## Intro
I am a Bristol-based dynamic tech professional with a "can-do" attitude who is happy to turn his hand to any challenge - in fact, fixing problems and helping people as part of a complex technial challenge are what I look for most in a job!

## Personal
I am a single parent and my teenage daughters keep me somewhat busy outside of work. While I am not working or looking after my girls, I like to play board games, video games, paint miniatures and make things (3d printing and carpentry are 2020/2021s most recent hobby additions) as well as learning programming and working on my own technical side projects. 

I am also passionate about educating and have volunteered at a local school teaching programming/web development.

## Professional Experience
### Simwood eSMS Ltd

**Ops Level 2**

_October 2020-Current_

Working for a well respected wholesale telephony provider, I provide support for all sorts from SIP phones troubleshooting with end-users to complex API queries and SIP diagnosis for other telephony providers. I also work on internal tooling, spotting and resolving infrastructure issues as well as helping with new product rollouts and documentation. Working in an agile environment, I even help out with building management and colleague QA!

#### Responsibilities include:
- Handling complex support tickets
- Investigating Network and SIP problems
- Crafting testing scenarios where necessary and recreating them on my own phone system (PBX)
- Supervising junior colleagues
- Managing projects
- Maintain interoparability documents and working with other providers 
- Collating the monthly team stats

#### Projects/Major Achievements

- I solved a longstanding escalated customer ticket by using grep and pcre regex to parse complex ISUP/SS7 traces/log files to search for commonalities and hardware faults
- To populate data and prevent _hours_ of manual entry, I created a nodejs script to parse data from a CRM (Hubspot) and then create customers in Zendesk (Ticketing system)
- To automate the uploading of Phone Book entries for customers, I created a JSExpress mini-site to allow uploading of CSVs to create them - ssaving internal resource and improving our customer service 
- I helped with the rapid introduction of automatically scaling and load-balancing Kamailio/Asterisk instances in a commercial environment (moving from bare-metal to EC2 on AWS)
