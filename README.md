**Original CV: https://github.com/alexlane87/cv**

## Intro
I am a Bristol-based dynamic tech professional with a "can-do" attitude who is happy to turn his hand to any challenge - in fact, fixing problems and helping people as part of a complex technical challenge are what I look for most in a job!

## Personal
I am a single parent and my teenage children keep me somewhat busy outside of work. While I am not working or looking after my girls, I like to play board games, video games, paint miniatures and make things (3d printing and carpentry are the most recent hobby additions).

I am also passionate about educating and have volunteered at a local school teaching programming/web development.

## Professional Experience
### Simwood eSMS Ltd

**Level 3 Engineer**

_May 2021-Current_
My most recent position in Simwood has seen me move to our Technology team, working in a multidisciplinary team in a hybrid on-premises and cloud environment. In this role I have been responsible for maintaining older Hardware & Software as well as implementing new systems and product features.

#### Responsibilities include:
 - Dev-Ops - Maintaining Docker containers on bare-metal hosts and within the cloud. Provisioning Infrastructure using Serverless, Helm, Docker-compose.

#### Projects/Major Achievements
 - I have designed and created a fully dockerised NodeJS application that automatically makes test calls (using SIPp) and interacts with multiple databases and external APIs. 
 - I spearheaded writing a NodeJS application to provision desk phones for our customers. This involved writing a templating engine interacting with multiple APIs alongside a front-facing Restful API that our customers can use to create new phone and extension associations all self-documented in Swagger.
 - Myself and a colleague orchestrated a site-refresh of one of our primary datacentres. This involved stripping old and rebuilding with new a rack of servers and networking equipment alongside integration into a newly provisioned dark fibre ring. 
 - I have trained multiple Engineers.
 - I have created a number of Python helper scripts to solve complex problems.

**Ops Level 2**

_October 2020-May 2021_

Working for a well respected wholesale telephony provider, I provide support for all sorts from SIP phones troubleshooting with end-users to complex API queries and SIP diagnosis for other telephony providers. I also work on internal tooling, spotting and resolving infrastructure issues as well as helping with new product rollouts and documentation. Working in an agile environment, I even help out with building management and colleague QA!

#### Responsibilities include:
- Handling complex support tickets
- Investigating Network and SIP problems
- Crafting testing scenarios where necessary and recreating them on my own phone system (PBX)
- Supervising junior colleagues
- Managing projects
- Maintain interoparability documents and working with other providers 
- Collating the monthly team stats

#### Projects/Major Achievements

- I solved a longstanding escalated customer ticket by using grep and pcre regex to parse complex ISUP/SS7 traces/log files to search for commonalities and hardware faults
- To populate data and prevent _hours_ of manual entry, I created a nodejs script to parse data from a CRM (Hubspot) and then create customers in Zendesk (Ticketing system)
- To automate the uploading of Phone Book entries for customers, I created a JSExpress mini-site to allow uploading of CSVs to create them - saving internal resource and improving our customer service 
- I helped with the rapid introduction of automatically scaling and load-balancing Kamailio/Asterisk instances in a commercial environment (moving from bare-metal to EC2 on AWS)
